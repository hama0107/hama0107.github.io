    <main>
        <p>My name is Iryna, I'm in my early 20<sup>th</sup>, and <em>I enjoi being creative</em>.I am currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">  IMD </abbr> at Algonquin College. I love photography because it allows me to freeze moments. I like to shoot on film, wait for the result, develop it, and then process and edit the pictures in Photoshop, adding more colours and meaning to them.</p>
        <p>I also like painting with oil paints because it is a slow and thoughtful process. I like to mix colors, work with the texture of the canvas and gradually convey my mood and my own thoughts through the paints.</p>
